This tutorial tries to help newcomers to cats-effect to get familiar with its main concepts by means of code examples,
in a learn-by-doing fashion. Two small programs will be coded, each one in its own section. The first one copies the
contents from one file to another, safely handling resources and cancelation in the process. That should help us to flex
our muscles. The second one implements a solution to the producer-consumer problem to introduce cats-effect fibers.
